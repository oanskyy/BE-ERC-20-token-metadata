API Endpoint
This tutorial uses the alchemy_getTokenMetadata endpoint.

Often when you are a DeFi app aggregating several tokens on your platform (like Uniswap), or an analytics app displaying data about thousands of tokens (like CoinGecko) - you need to show the metadata for several tokens. The metadata includes important fields like the token's name, symbol, and logo.

Alchemy's Token API endpoint getTokenMetadata can come in handy for use-cases like that! In this tutorial, we will fetch the metadata for the USDT token.
